# 🕵️ SQL Murder Mystery - Who Killed the CEO? — Case Solved 🔍  
Final Capstone Project | Indian Data Club 21-Days SQL Challenge

This project is part of the **Indian Data Club (IDC) 21-Days SQL Challenge**, sponsored by **DPDzero**.

In this case-driven project, I used SQL to solve a murder mystery:
the CEO of TechNova Inc. was found dead — and the truth was hidden in the database!

---

## 🎯 Investigation Goal
Use only SQL to find:

✔️ Where the crime happened  
✔️ When the crime happened  
✔️ Who accessed the crime scene  
✔️ Who lied in their alibi  
✔️ Who made a suspicious phone call  
✔️ And ultimately — who the killer is  

---

## 🗂️ Database Used
The dataset contains 5 tables:

| Table Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| employees | Employee details |
| keycard_logs | Room entry/exit logs |
| calls | Phone call records |
| alibis | Claimed locations |
| evidence | Forensic findings |

## 🔍 Final Outcome — Case Solved

> **Killer Identified: David Kumar**  
> 👤 Employee ID: 4  
> 🏢 Department: Engineering  
> 🎯 Role: DevOps Engineer  

He was:
- Inside the CEO Office during the crime time
- Lied about his location (false alibi)
- Made a suspicious call  
- Left fingerprints + keycard mismatch as evidence

**All evidence pointed to one person — Case Closed.**
